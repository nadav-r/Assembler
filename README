Final Project in C Lab (maman 14)- An Assembler 
AUTHOR Nadav R
 

Genral outline:
The assembler parses the text, and saves information in three lists - instruction list, symbol list and data list.
Then it assembles them by translating the information to machine code as specified in the assignment's guidelines and  it prints them
to the object file.
In addition, if ther are .extern lines it creates .ext file and if there are .entry lines a .ent file.
